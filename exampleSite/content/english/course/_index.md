description : "Currently, there are four overarching committees that are supported by hundreds of members across the student body. The structure will continue to evolve as the response grows. The Response Team embraces the principles of being adaptive, nimble, and inclusive for all initiatives that will optimize our collective impact as a medical student body. We will be planning to post more updates on a full website shortly along with highlighting various initiatives within each of the existing committees."
